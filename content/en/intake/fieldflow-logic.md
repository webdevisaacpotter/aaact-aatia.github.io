		<p>The AAACT program offers workshops and presentations throughout the year in English and French.  We run many of the sessions quarterly and it is best to check and register for sessions on our GCpedia page: <a href = "https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GC_Accessibility_Training_and_Events_/_Formation_et_événements_du_GC_sur_l%27accessibilité">Accessibility Training and Events</a>.<br><br>
		Some of these events are about document accessibility. Every document created must be accessible by default. This workshop teaches participants how to implement accessibility requirements through presentations, demonstrations, and exercises. <br><br>
		<strong>Overview of adaptive technology in-depth and mobile tools and technologies</strong><br>
		This session provides an overview of available technologies and approaches within the federal public service to eliminate barriers for people with different learning styles, cognitive and learning disabilities. The AAACT client services team showcases the most common tools within the federal government for supporting clients. There may be opportunities to test out the adaptive technologies.<br><br>
		<strong>Overview of AAACT and the no wrong door approach</strong>
		This session offers an overview of the AAACT program, services, and tools available to all federal employees across Canada. AAACT promotes a "no wrong door" approach amongst Chief Information Officer Branch (CIOB), Human Resources (HR), Employment Equity (EE), Occupational Safety & Health (OSH), and Accommodations in federal government departments, providing expertise and support to management as it responds to the needs of employees with disabilities or injuries.<br><br>
		<strong>Essentials for managers and HR professionals</strong><br>
		This session is an expanded version of the “Overview of AAACT and The No Wrong Door Approach to Job Accommodation – Working Together on a Barrier Free Workplace” session that targets HR professionals and managers and expands on the services, support and best practices.<br><br>
		<strong>Procuring accessible information communication technologies (ICT)</strong><br>
		When buying software, hardware, and other types of ICT, if you don’t ask for accessibility, you won’t get it. What contract language and processes will help us reach our goal of being “the most accessible public service in the world”? This session provides an overview of the Accessible Canada Act (ACA), the Accessibility Strategy for the public service, roles and responsibilities of technical and contracting authorities, and how SSC supports the procurement of accessible ICT goods and services.<br><br>
		<strong>High visibility: no eye strain, no pain</strong><br>
		There are many ways to modify your computer and display settings to increase content readability. This session explores setting changes, free add-ons to install on your computer, and software available to enlarge, magnify, and improve readability of material.
		Through this session, participants gain an understanding of techniques and available options to improve material readability, reduce eye strain, and gain an enhanced computer use experience.<br><br>
		<strong>Inclusion by design: information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility</strong><br>
		This session raises awareness on accessibility-related issues and empowers participants as leaders in implementing solutions. Technology is used to demonstrate the various impacts of accessible/inaccessible content. This session is geared towards:
		<ul>
			<li>managers with business requirements to publish content on the web.</li>
			<li>communication specialists, content creators or publishers.</li>
			<li>web publishers who distribute information in alternative formats.</li>
			<li>applications or software developers.</li>

		<p>Unfortunately, we do not test Microsoft products as some M365 applications have already been flagged for having some accessibility issues. The <a href= "https://www.canada.ca/en/shared-services/corporate/digital-communications-collaboration.html">SSC Digital Communications and Collaboration</a> (DCC) has a group in charge of communicating these issues to Microsoft. You can check out the known issues that the DCC has listed on <a href = "https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Probl%C3%A8mes_d%27accessibilit%C3%A9_M365_Accessibility_Issues">M365 Accessibility Issues - GCpedia</a> and <a href = "https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/7/77/SSC-DCC-M365-Accessibility-Issues-Tracker-EN.xlsx">The SSC DCC Accessibility Issues Tracker</a>.<br><br> Please note that when you are using a Microsoft product not all issues that you find will be solvable by you; only Microsoft can resolve them. If you encounter an issue that is not in DCC’s list, please engage with the official process for filing issues to Microsoft described on below.<br></p>
		<h3> How to file issues to Microsoft</h3>
		<p>When any GC partner/department/service encounter an accessibility issue with any Microsoft product such as SharePoint, Power Apps, MS Dynamics, Forms, MS Teams, etc., they need to send it to the DCC UX team (<a href= "mailto:dcc-ssc.accessibility-accessibilite@ssc-spc.gc.ca">dcc-ssc.accessibility-accessibilite@ssc-spc.gc.ca</a>) and DCC take care of submitting the issue to Microsoft.<br><br>
		<strong>Why do we recommend that you go through the DCC UX team?</strong><br>
		The main reason is that DCC needs to fill out a Microsoft form to provide all the details about the issue. They must review the form for quality assurance before they submit it so that they can make sure Microsoft doesn’t reject the form as DCC upload all the tickets details from the testing template directly to Microsoft system.<br>
		The template has 3 main sheets to be filled out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Information Modal: this contains how to fill out the form, what is required or not and all the details on how to read through the template. </li>
			<li>Form:  Details of the issue/ issues (more than 1 issue can be added)</li>
			<li>Snapshots: Screenshots, print screens, images, pictures that need to be sent to Microsoft as well, about the issue contained in the “Form” sheet.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, GC departments/partners can also use their mailbox (<a href= "mailto:dcc-ssc.accessibility-accessibilite@ssc-spc.gc.ca">dcc-ssc.accessibility-accessibilite@ssc-spc.gc.ca</a>) to raise their M365 Official Language issues and we will take care to submit them to Microsoft as well. No need to use the template for Official Language, the template is only for Accessibility issues.<br><br>
		You can find and evaluate ACRs from Microsoft and make informed decisions about technology used to build an inclusive workplace by browsing the <a href= "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/conformance-reports">Microsoft - Accessibility Conformance Reports</a>.<br><br>

		<p>An Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) and a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) are tools used to assess and communicate the accessibility of information and communication technology (ICT) products and services. Here’s a detailed look at each:<br><br>
		<strong>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</strong><br>
		VPAT is a standardized document that suppliers of ICT products and services use to describe how their products or services conform to accessibility standards. These standards are typically outlined in the EN 301 549 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The VPAT helps buyers, particularly government agencies, to assess the accessibility of the products and services they are considering purchasing.<br><br> <strong>Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR)</strong><br> An ACR is a completed VPAT. Once the supplier fills out the VPAT with detailed information about their product’s compliance with accessibility standards, it becomes the ACR. The ACR is the final report used to convey the accessibility compliance status of a product or service to potential buyers.<br><br>
