As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to host more live events and continue offering in-person training and engagement sessions. We’re also enhancing our client service process to make it faster and more efficient. Let’s continue to push boundaries, embrace innovation, and champion inclusivity every step of the way. Together, we are creating a world where accessibility isn’t just a goal, it’s the standard.

## Creating a Culture of Inclusion

A positive workplace culture plays a key role in fostering an inclusive environment for all employees, including persons with disabilities. It’s about creating an environment where all employees feel valued and empowered. It brings together a collective way of thinking and doing, establishing norms that define what is encouraged and accepted within the organization. When shared often, culture resonates more deeply, fostering a sense of unity and alignment among individuals, influencing how they interact, make decisions, and contribute to the overall environment.

A model of disability inclusion is built on three key pillars: environment, culture, and individual adjustments. The environment should be barrier-free, designed to accommodate diverse users, ensuring accessibility for all. The culture must be free of discrimination, fostering respect and valuing differences, creating an inclusive atmosphere for everyone. Lastly, individual adjustments, such as adaptive equipment, tools, and support measures, are essential to ensure that all employees have what they need to thrive and contribute fully. Together, these elements create an environment where disability inclusion is not just a goal but a standard practice.

Language plays a critical role in fostering diversity and inclusion. Words matter, and the vocabulary we use can either contribute to or challenge ableism—the prejudice, bias, and discrimination directed toward people with disabilities. By choosing inclusive language, we promote understanding and respect, signaling a commitment to equality and inclusion for all individuals.

So, how can we be allies to those with disabilities? Start by making a conscious effort to improve your vocabulary. Small changes in terminology—like saying “accessible workplace” instead of “accommodations”—can make a significant difference. Acknowledge disability and be open to learning about the experiences of those with disabilities. Don't make assumptions about someone's identity and always ensure that individuals with disabilities are included in conversations and decision-making processes. If you make a mistake, take the time to apologize sincerely. Above all, integrate accessibility into everything you do—from meetings to resources, to your everyday interactions.

By understanding the model of disability inclusion—focusing on a barrier-free environment, a culture free from discrimination, and providing individual adjustments and support measures — federal public service employees can positively influence workplace culture. This commitment will not only ensure that people with disabilities feel valued and included but will also enrich the workplace, promoting diversity and inclusion for everyone.

## Rossy's Journey

![](../../../public/img/newsletters/rosy_and_sophie.jpg)

Alt text: Image of Sophie and Rossy, a service dog in training.

Training a service dog is no small feat. It requires patience, consistency, and a deep bond of trust between handler and dog. But beyond the training lies an even more complex challenge: navigating the world with a service dog by your side. For many, this means trying to integrate into the workplace. Sophie Lavigne-Labelle’s journey with her service dog has been filled with both heartwarming successes and frustrating obstacles, particularly when it comes to socializing in a professional environment. Read on to learn about the unique challenges she faced and how it all came together.

"Fostering for the Mira Foundation has always been a dream of mine; being able to help others is something I’m passionate about, especially those living with challenges, such as people with visual or motor impairments, or young people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). My professional experience as a special education technician and teacher of students with ASD has shown me how the presence of an animal can have significant benefits on children’s development and well-being. These days, the title of public servant with the federal government isn’t enough for me, but being involved and being able to give back to a non-profit organization like the Mira Foundation is my way of contributing to our society.

Back then, there were a lot of obstacles in my job to getting permission to bring a Mira Foundation puppy undergoing socialization into my work environment. Initially, however, there were no objections. On January 12, 2024, I opened my heart to this beautiful nine-week-old puppy, named Rossy, for a period of 18 months, with the responsibility of teaching her all the basics of daily life, including maintaining good health, developing good behaviour and socializing her so that she could be chosen for the guide-dog or service-dog program. It’s worth noting that I’d taken the necessary steps for approval and the department had issued a departmental photo ID card for Rossy. However, from one day to the next, I was denied access, and that’s when the difficulties and obstacles began.

Despite the lack of support within my team, I decided to turn to the Treasury Board Secretariat’s accessibility team, especially Clara Morgan, Alfred MacLeod and Angela Wellman, whose support proved to be decisive. We had the approval of Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) and all the required documentation, namely the official letter of socialization, proof of vaccination, schedule of behaviour classes and proof of insurance from the Mira Foundation. Despite all these efforts, and even with the support of Mira Foundation general manager, the project was turned down. I was starting to panic, and my patience was wearing thin, because the days were passing and Rossy had already been coming to the office with me for four months. The Foundation was aware that I wasn’t fulfilling my fostering role, which was to socialize the dog in the workplace, and my next step was to lose custody of Rossy.

However, a solution was found thanks to the unwavering support I received from Clara, Alfred and Angela. Nadine Charron, Executive Director of the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology Program, readily agreed to host us in her office. With her support, we were able to contribute to Rossy’s healthy behavioural development while reinforcing the importance of accessibility and inclusion in our workplace.

“Clara’s request to host Rossy in our offices was a ‘Yes!’” says Nadine. She goes on to say that a default yes should be how we work and keep moving towards genuine diversity in the workplace. With Rossy, we’ll be able to contribute to helping a child or adult join the ranks of the federal public service or another global workforce.

Rossy’s first day of work was April 12, 2024, and she adjusted perfectly to her new environment from the very start, forming bonds with many of her new coworkers. With her calm temperament, she quickly established herself as a soothing, caring presence.

Rossy is now 15 months old and has met all of the Mira Foundation’s evaluation criteria with flying colours. I’m very proud to report that she’s been chosen for the service-dog program designed to support a child with an autism spectrum disorder. While we wait for a call from the Mira Foundation to begin her training, she’ll continue to come to the office with me and put smiles on the faces of public servants.

Despite the many obstacles, I’ve come to realize the importance of surrounding myself with people who not only believe in the possibility of changing lives, but who also share a common vision of an accessible and inclusive workplace. I can never thank the accessibility teams headed by Clara and Nadine enough; their commitment and support enabled me to make my dream come true: not only to change a child’s life but also, unexpectedly, to change my own."

## Get to Know the Team

![](../../../public/img/newsletters/picture1.png)

Text alt: Peter McCormick holds up a square shaped device labeled “X-Keys, XK-12 USB Switch Interface.” Peter has a tightly cropped grey beard and is wearing a headset.

Imagine being able to improve someone’s work life with a simple piece of technology, like a monitor or plug-in accessory? Peter McCormick does that every day in his role as an IT technician with the Accessibility, Accommodations and Adaptive Computer Technology program. Peter creates customized solutions so clients can work efficiently and comfortably. He blends his specialized technical expertise with a good dose of compassion. We caught up with Peter between clients.

### You interact with several new clients every week from across the government of Canada. What are the common accessibility challenges they encounter?

Many clients mention feeling completely exhausted or in pain at the end of the day. Many are dealing with brain trauma or concussion, either from a recent event or past injury. Standard issue screens are particularly challenging for them. After looking at a monitor all day, they find it very difficult to enjoy other aspects of their life.

I can relate. I have a type of brain injury called arterial vascular malformation or an AV malformation. I’ve been living with the symptoms since I was 13 years old. I sometimes share my experiences with my clients to let them know that I understand on so many levels.

### With the range of disabilities and different ways people work, how do you determine the best solutions for your clients?

The first thing to know is that even though we're all technicians with a background in computer technology, a big part of our work is compassion. We rely on our compassion and empathy to relate to what our clients are going through.

People who come to us are very vulnerable. They might have just suffered a life changing event like an injury, illness, or new disability. Some are hesitant to seek help because they are trying to be “normal” and work like everyone else. But sometimes, we need different tools to do our work. My job is to set up my clients with a personalized set of tools.

### The AAACT team has an inventory of hundreds of different types of equipment, software, and peripheral devices. What are the workhorses in your inventory?

There are some devices that have multiple applications or serve many purposes. For example, the XK-12 USB. The palm-size square is a type of macro keypad. It plugs into a computer, and I can program each of the 12 keys to perform specific functions that are customized for each client.

I had a client who had difficulty dragging his finger across the computer touch pad to move the cursor. I programmed the macro keypad, so he could move the cursor using foot pedals. He was able to do single and double mouse clicks with his feet. For others with issues with dexterity or fine motor skills, I can create a shortcut so they can activate their mouse with almost no force or an extremely light touch.

Another useful tool is the E-ink monitor. It’s a monitor that uses every shade of gray, or greyscale, instead of colour. It is less strenuous on the eyes compared to a standard monitor. For people with vertigo or concussion symptoms, the E-ink monitor can be a game-changer. We also have a curved monitor which replaces two monitors side-by side. A curved monitor mimics the curvature of the eye and prevents people from having to refocus from one monitor to another. People who manage eye fatigue, headaches, migraines, or concussion notice a big difference.

It’s amazing how one small piece of technology or tool can change a life. Some of my clients get emotional when they get their adaptive technology. They actually cry. Many tell me they can go out after work, play with their kids, and resume their lives. It is incredibly rewarding to see clients succeed.

### What can a prospective client expect when they contact you and your colleagues for adaptive and assistive technologies?

The first thing is the initial session with myself and other AAACT support staff, as it makes sense. More often than not, the client’s manager will also attend. This introductory meeting helps the client, and their manager understand how our team operates and what services and supports we can offer. At the same time, we get to know the client, their day-to-day tasks and how they carry out those tasks.

After the introductory session, we schedule an exploratory meeting. I meet one-on-one with the client to explore the range of potential solutions, like devices, software, and furniture. By the end of the meeting, we usually agree on a possible tool or set of tools.

From there, I coordinate with their manager, their IT department, facilities, and other departments to either loan the needed equipment from our Lending Library to the client for a specific testing period or to place an order and arrange the delivery of the required tools. Once the tools are delivered and installed, I conduct the training and orientation with the client.

Through AAACT’s Lending Library clients have the flexibility to try and test the different gear. They can return what doesn’t work for them and try other solutions. If other needs arise, or if the client’s situation changes, we can re-evaluate and look for other tools.

There are many ways that we can help you out. Just come and see what we can do for you.

## Accessible Canada Regulations Amendment

The proposed amendments to the Accessible Canada Regulations (ACR) are available in [Canada Gazette, Part I](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.cyberimpact.com%2Fredirect%3Fct%3DvI1KNEmXxbXPXTxlKeOpNbrJdKzAKREhXpfrz33ZKkG0TnMEZ8GPuTkgHcZdCdfC3RnAKVbezFjzmdsu0ggMPEnKXa3r2CCehzaDQts3udNeNJnW-mymqII3Qwmft_Ko&data=05%7C02%7Cgenevieve.brown%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C00f78eb8205e4a3d045308dd40890848%7Cd05bc19494bf4ad6ae2e1db0f2e38f5e%7C0%7C0%7C638737679480480040%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=kFI%2BUH8d%2BPGxmOl%2F1ytFAal39FzRWBAKEIWLNdPEdVk%3D&reserved=0). These amendments would establish a new Part under the ACR called “Information and Communication Technologies” with new requirements relating to digital accessibility.

Canadians have until February 19, 2025, to review the proposed amendments to the ACR and offer their feedback by following these [instructions](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.cyberimpact.com%2Fredirect%3Fct%3DoRsBHdeBTWAFzoM4yL4aemtNHANIC3yTt_2KWGuPhkJeDks_PVdTI46MzoQyt27tzB5FhCoiEX7QmWAYWDWcsjG7nTDfgWDgAPWLObOHjUIplr_jUhPaSv9umzGtkcji&data=05%7C02%7Cgenevieve.brown%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C00f78eb8205e4a3d045308dd40890848%7Cd05bc19494bf4ad6ae2e1db0f2e38f5e%7C0%7C0%7C638737679480497160%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=IJqAGO%2Fdly2vazBqJXINSKFRMLRwRFsjFdjptdSGtk8%3D&reserved=0). 

## Accessibility Feedback Spotlight

We recently received a question via the [SSC’s accessibility feedback form](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.cyberimpact.com%2Fredirect%3Fct%3DQcZb3g7aVZb3n3DQZMhjP6NjBMsZeQJ-1PHiVdfvj93Z3dTSaTDns1P4PYJ8r2D2X1ucRieG4XnkVHbbS_3ae2Emh-dv39KlGMXfELS5zQvo4X8v2B9fgyY7nPYamaxI&data=05%7C02%7Cgenevieve.brown%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C00f78eb8205e4a3d045308dd40890848%7Cd05bc19494bf4ad6ae2e1db0f2e38f5e%7C0%7C0%7C638737679480515535%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6Dt2mxiYrTHWM0XVU3ZhAh5aEiQ9TRTUgen8dHR8BGg%3D&reserved=0) regarding which fonts are considered accessible when creating documents, such as PowerPoint presentation or Word. At SSC, we have adopted Aptos as the new default font for the online and desktop version of Microsoft Outlook. However, it’s important to note that there isn’t a one-size-fits all solution for accessibility. Other accessible font options, like Calibri and Arial, are also great choices.

The initial setup of default theme fonts is the responsibility of your desktop applications group. You can find out the general default font by opening the application and selecting File > New. You can also control the default font for a Word and PowerPoint documents by creating a template file, then basing your new files on the template. This will help save time when creating new documents and ensure the chosen font is included.

Regardless of the font you choose, here are some document accessibility tips related to fonts.

* Use sans-serif fonts such as Aptos, Arial, Verdana, and Calibri.
* The minimum recommended font size for:

  * Outlook messages is 11 points
  * Word documents is 12 points
  * PowerPoint presentations is 18 points
* Avoid using italics for more than a few words.
