Attending the a11yTO Conference in Toronto was such a valuable experience. The energy there was incredible—people from all over, deeply committed to making digital spaces more inclusive. I have to say, being there in person made a real difference. There were so many insightful conversations that happened in the hallways and over coffee breaks, things that just don't happen as easily when we're remote. It really drove home how important these in-person connections are for fostering community and collaboration.

There were many thought-provoking presentations, but four really stood out to me as directly relevant to our work on digital accessibility for the Government of Canada:

## 1. "An Accessibility Knowledge Hub: If You Build It, Will They Come?"

This talk really hit home because it mirrors what we're trying to do with our Digital Accessibility Toolkit (DAT). It explored how to create centralized resources for accessibility and how to actually get people to use them effectively. It reminded me that building the toolkit is just the beginning—it's about promoting it and involving the community to make sure it’s truly valuable and widely used.

## 2. "Built-in Accessibility: Blessing or Curse?"

This one tackled whether built-in accessibility features really meet the needs of all users. It offered a balanced view of the benefits and the limitations of those built-in solutions. The presenter, Hidde de Vries, from the Dutch Government, shared some interesting insights from their Netherlands Design System, which brings different government entities together to standardize accessibility across ministries, cities, and public services. What's great is that they are willing to share all their work and materials. The presenter emphasized that all of their work is open source and available on GitHub, promoting transparency—something that aligns well with our own DAT goals. Speaking with Hidde, it was clear that they face similar challenges in encouraging public servants to work openly, much like we do.

## 3. "Decoding the Impact: Accessibility Overlays Through a Scientific Lens"

This presentation was a deep dive into accessibility overlays—those quick-fix solutions you see marketed as making websites accessible overnight. What was nice about this presentation was that it showed the results of real users and their experiences, as it broke down why these solutions can often fall short or even create new barriers for users. It reinforced for me that our focus needs to be on getting the fundamentals right rather than relying on shortcuts.

## 4. "Holding Vendors Accountable - Designing Your Own Accessibility Vendor Monitoring Program"

This was incredibly practical. It gave a great framework for how to keep vendors accountable and ensure that third-party tools meet accessibility standards. The presenter from Navy Federal shared their strategy for vendor accountability, and what stood out was their willingness to share everything with us—giving us a solid foundation to build on for our own projects. This approach highlighted the importance of accessible procurement and provided actionable strategies for ensuring standards are consistently set and monitored.

## Other Notable Sessions

* **"Accessibility Conformance Reports: Scoring with Confidence"**
* **"Advancing Accessibility"**
* **"The State of Mobile App Accessibility: Guidelines, Cross-Platform Frameworks, and more!"**

Each of these sessions offered some great insights and different approaches to inclusive design that we can apply to our DAT work. The chance to talk with peers afterward really helped bring these ideas to life—getting a sense of how others are tackling similar challenges.

Overall, attending a11yTO reinforced for me just how important it is to have a presence at these kinds of events. It’s not just about learning—it’s about positioning ourselves within the accessibility community, connecting with others, and showing that we’re committed to leading in this space. The insights I gained and the connections I made are going to be incredibly valuable for the work we're doing going forward.
